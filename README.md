## MODX Queeg (Chrome extension)

Tiny Chrome and Opera extension that provides a **one-click** access to MODX Resources from a website to its manager.

Queeg works together with [this MODX Extra](https://github.com/baoweb/modx-queeg). You can **easily open a resource for editing** just by **one click** and also get additional information about the resource when you **hover over the icon**.
