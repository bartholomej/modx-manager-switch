# MODX Queeg (Chrome extension)

> Tiny web extension that provides a **one-click** access to MODX Resources from a website to its manager.

Queeg works together with [this MODX Extra](https://github.com/baoweb/modx-queeg). You can **easily open a resource for editing** just by **one click** and also get additional information about the resource when you **hover over the icon**.

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Privacy Policy

I DO NOT STORE ANY DATA. PERIOD.

I physically can't. I have nowhere to store it. I don't even have a server database to store it. So even if Justin Bieber asked nicely to see your data, I wouldn't have anything to show him.

That's why, with modx-queeg, what happens on your device stays on your device till disappear.
